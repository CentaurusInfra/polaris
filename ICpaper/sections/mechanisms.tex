\subsection{Implementation Considerations}
\todo{add}
Next we discuss preliminary solution
design and implementation considerations of our SLOC framework.
In general, the SLOC framework aims to build on and extend our previous
work and frameworks: Arktos, MELA and SYBL.
%
As Arktos evolved from the Kubernetes codebase, introducing several fundamental 
improvements, we intend to continue the development of SLOC framework
in the same direction, effectively aligning it both with Arktos and Kubernetes.
