# Predictions

One of the central features of the Polaris project, is the prediction of the evolvement of high-level metrics in the near future.
This allows elasticity strategies to not be triggered only reactively, but also proactively.

To learn more about predictions in Polaris, please refer to the [polaris-ai](https://github.com/polaris-slo-cloud/polaris-ai) subproject.
