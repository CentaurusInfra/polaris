# Predictions

One of the central features of the Polaris project, is the prediction of the evolvement of high-level metrics in the near future.
This allows elasticity strategies to not be triggered only reactively, but also proactively.
The predicted metrics will be exposed as composed metrics libraries.

To learn more about predictions in Polaris, please refer to the [polaris-ai](https://github.com/polaris-slo-cloud/polaris-ai) subproject.
