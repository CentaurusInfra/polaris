# Cassandra Monitoring Manual Setup

This folder contains configuration files for setting up a Cassandra cluster using Kubernetes and monitoring it with Prometheus.

Until now the setup of the Cassandra cluster, as well as that of Prometheus and Grafana are working, but Cassandra cannot be monitored with the current config.

Code from the following guides was used and adapted:
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/cassandra/
* https://medium.com/faun/production-grade-kubernetes-monitoring-using-prometheus-78144b835b60
