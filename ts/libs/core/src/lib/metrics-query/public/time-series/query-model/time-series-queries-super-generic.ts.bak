/**
 * A query that results in `TimeSeries` and which provides operations that are
 * applicable to all `TimeSeries` queries.
 *
 * There are two main types of TimeSeriesQueries:
 * - `TimeRangeQuery`, whose execution results in an array of `TimeSeries`, each normally containing multiple samples.
 * - `TimeInstantQuery`, whose execution results in an array of `TimeSeriesInstant` objects, each containing a single sample.
 *
 * `TimeInstantQuery` also allows applying filters on the values of the `TimeSeries`.
 *
 * Both main query types may be combined with `LabelFilterableQuery`, which allows filtering on labels.
 * A query resulting from a `TimeSeriesSource.select()` will be either
 * - a `LabelFilterableTimeRangeQuery = TimeRangeQuery & LabelFilterableQuery`, if a `TimeRange` was specified, or
 * - a `LabelFilterableTimeInstantQueryQuery = TimeInstantQuery & LabelFilterableQuery`, if no `TimeRange` was specified.
 *
 * The use of one of any method other than `filterOnLabel()`, will usually
 * result in the loss of the label-filterable functionality for the rest of the query, because
 * some DBs only support label filtering on the stored data, but not on computed data.
 *
 * A `TimeSeriesQuery` realization is immutable to allow query objects to be reused in multiple places.
 *
 * @param T The type of `TimeSeries` that is returned by this query.
