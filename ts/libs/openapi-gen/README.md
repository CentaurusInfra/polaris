# @polaris-sloc/openapi-gen

This library supports the generation of [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) v3 specifications from TypeScript code.

## OpenAPI Specification Generation

This library relies on OpenAPI data generated by the [@nestjs/swagger](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) package.
That package leverages runtime type metadata that is generated at compile time using a [TypeScript transformer](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/cli-plugin).

**ToDo: Remove once next Nx version is published.**
To allow the use of TypeScript transformers, a custom build of Nx, based on [this PR]() is needed until the next version of Nx is officially released.
Such a custom build can be installed using a [local npm registry](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#publishing-to-a-local-registry).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test openapi-gen` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
